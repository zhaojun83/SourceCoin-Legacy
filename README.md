What is SourceCoin-Legacy?
SourceCoin-Legacy is a compact, educational cryptocurrency project written in Python. It provides a simple wallet, a lightweight blockchain with a basic proof-of-work mechanism, and a small API layer you can use to create transactions, inspect the chain, and manage wallets. The project emphasizes clarity over complexity, making it a good starting point for learning about crypto concepts such as blocks, transactions, hashes, and consensus.

The idea behind SourceCoin-Legacy is to offer a practical, runnable demonstration that you can read, run, and extend. The code is designed to be readable and approachable. It is not meant to be a production-ready cryptocurrency. It is a learning tool, a playground for exploring how a crypto wallet and a blockchain can work together, and a stepping stone for building more advanced features.

Why this project matters
- It demonstrates core concepts in a tangible way. You can see how a chain of blocks connects, how transactions are formed, and how a wallet can sign and verify messages.
- It gives you a practical sandbox to learn Python coding while tackling real-world ideas like cryptography, serialization, and network interfaces.
- It serves as a reference implementation for educational purposes. You can compare it with other open-source projects to understand design tradeoffs.
- It helps developers understand how a minimal API can expose essential actions without adding unnecessary complexity.

Core components and concepts
- Blockchain core: A simple sequence of blocks. Each block contains an index, a timestamp, a list of transactions, a hash of the previous block, and a nonce. The chain is tamper-evident: altering a block would require recomputing hashes for subsequent blocks.
- Transactions: Transfers of SourceCoin from one wallet to another. A transaction includes the sender, recipient, amount, and a timestamp. Signatures provide authenticity and non-repudiation.
- Wallets: Public/private key pairs to identify users. Public keys serve as wallet addresses. Private keys sign transactions to prove ownership of funds.
- Proof of work: A lightweight consensus mechanism that requires a miner to discover a nonce that satisfies a simple difficulty condition. This helps deter bad actors, even in a learning environment.
- API: A small REST-like interface (or a minimal HTTP server) to fetch the blockchain, submit transactions, view wallet balances, and simulate mining. The API is intentionally compact to keep the focus on the underlying concepts.
- Persistence: The chain and wallet data are stored locally in JSON files. This keeps setup simple and makes it easy to inspect data structures.
- CLI and examples: A command-line interface helps you experiment with creating wallets, sending coins, querying the chain, and starting a local node.

Getting started quickly
Quick-start path for learners
- Prerequisites: A modern Python 3 environment (3.8 or newer works well). Make sure you have pip available to install dependencies.
- Clone or download: Get the code from the repository. If you are using a release, download the asset from the releases page and follow the instructions for your platform.
- Install dependencies: Run pip install -r requirements.txt. This pulls in the libraries needed by the sample API and the wallet components.
- Run the local API or CLI: Start the local server or run the CLI sample to interact with the system. The exact commands depend on how you install and package SourceCoin-Legacy, but you will typically start a module or a script that launches the API and the wallet interface.
- Try a simple workflow: Create a wallet, check your balance, create a transaction to another wallet, and mine a block if the miner is available. You will see how a transaction moves from creation to inclusion in the blockchain.

From the releases page, download and run the main asset
- The releases page is the primary way to obtain a packaged version of SourceCoin-Legacy. On that page you will find platform-specific assets such as installers or tarballs. Download the asset named in a way that matches your platform, for example a Windows installer or a Linux/macOS package. The asset is designed to be executable with minimal setup.
- After downloading the asset, run it according to your system conventions. On Windows, this might be an installer or a self-contained executable. On Linux or macOS, you may extract a package and run a Python script or a small launcher.
- If you prefer to inspect the code or run it directly from source, you can download the repository and run the Python modules directly. The source approach helps you learn by reading and modifying the code.

Note: The releases page hosts multiple assets for different platforms. If you run into any issues with a specific asset, check the corresponding release notes for compatibility details, dependencies, and known issues. The releases section is the best place to learn about versioning, changes, and improvements.

Project structure and architecture
- src/: Core source code for the wallet, blockchain, and API. This folder holds modules that implement the main features.
- src/blockchain/: Blockchain logic, including block structure, hashing, and the consensus mechanism.
- src/wallet/: Wallet module for key generation, signing, and public address handling.
- src/api/: Lightweight API layer that exposes endpoints to submit transactions, query the chain, and check balances.
- tests/: A set of simple tests to exercise the core functionality. Tests help you verify that changes do not break expectations.
- examples/: Small demonstration scripts to show typical usage patterns, such as simulating a transaction flow and mining a block.
- docs/: Documentation fragments that describe data models, API schemas, and design decisions.
- scripts/: Convenience scripts for local development, setup, and environment preparation.
- requirements.txt: A list of Python dependencies used by the project. Keeping dependencies small helps readability and reduces setup friction.

Data models and persistence
- Block: A block contains an index, timestamp, a list of transactions, the hash of the previous block, and a nonce produced by the proof-of-work algorithm.
- Transaction: A transaction records sender, recipient, amount, timestamp, and an optional digital signature. Signatures ensure that only the owner of a wallet can authorize transfers.
- Wallet: A wallet based on a public/private key pair. The public key is the address. Private keys sign messages to prove ownership.
- Chain persistence: The blockchain and wallets are serialized to JSON files for easy inspection and restoration. Reading and writing JSON keeps the data human-readable and easy to modify during experiments.

API usage and examples
- Endpoints (conceptual, lightweight): 
  - GET /blocks: Retrieve the current blockchain.
  - POST /transactions: Submit a new transaction. The payload includes sender, recipient, amount, and signature.
  - GET /wallets/{address}: Fetch balance and wallet details.
  - POST /mine: Trigger the mining process to add a new block with pending transactions.
  - GET /status: Return basic health and status information about the node.
- Interaction patterns: Use the API to submit transactions, watch for new blocks, and verify balances. In a learning environment, you can run multiple local nodes to observe how blocks propagate and how the chain grows.
- Example payloads: The JSON structures are human-readable. You can construct a transaction payload with the sender’s address, recipient’s address, amount, timestamp, and a cryptographic signature created with the sender’s private key.

Wallet features and security basics
- Wallet creation: Generate a private/public key pair. The public key serves as the wallet address. The private key must stay private; it signs transactions to prove ownership.
- Signing: Transactions are signed with the private key. The signature proves that the sender controlled the private key corresponding to the sender’s address.
- Balances: Balances are determined by scanning the blockchain. Each transaction contributes to the available balance and unspent outputs are tracked locally.
- Security basics: Keep private keys on a secure device. Use a passphrase or encryption to protect keys at rest. If you lose a private key, you lose access to the funds associated with that wallet.

Blockchain logic and consensus
- Chain integrity: Each block references the previous block by hash. This linkage makes the chain tamper-evident.
- Proof of work: The algorithm requires a nonce that satisfies a difficulty condition. Miners perform computations to discover a valid nonce and then broadcast the new block.
- Consensus on a single chain: In a simple environment, the longest valid chain is considered the authoritative chain. If two miners produce different blocks simultaneously, the network will converge on the longer chain as more blocks are added.
- Handling forks: Forks are natural in a distributed network. The implementation handles fork resolution by choosing the longest valid chain, ensuring eventual consistency after network stabilization.

Running SourceCoin-Legacy locally
- Environment setup: Install Python 3.x, create a virtual environment if desired, and install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
- Running the API and wallet: Start the API server or CLI tool that ships with SourceCoin-Legacy. The exact commands depend on how the release is packaged, but you will typically run a module or script that launches the local node and exposes endpoints.
- Interacting with the node: Use curl, a simple HTTP client, or the built-in CLI to query blocks, submit transactions, and mine blocks. A typical flow is to create wallets, fund them through a genesis-like transaction, and perform a transfer.
- Observing results: Each mined block adds a new entry to the blockchain. You can view block data, transaction details, and wallet balances to verify correctness.
- Local testing: Change transaction values, simulate multiple wallets, and observe how the chain grows. The codebase is designed to be easy to inspect and modify, which helps you learn quickly.

Code quality, tests, and examples
- Tests: Basic tests ensure core behavior such as transaction creation, signature verification, block hashing, and chain integrity. Tests help you confirm that modifications maintain expected behavior.
- Examples: The examples directory contains short scripts that illustrate typical flows. You can run these scripts to see how wallet creation, transaction submission, and mining interact.
- Documentation and docs: The docs directory contains design notes, data models, and API schemas. Reading these documents helps you understand the decisions behind the implementation.
- Style and readability: The code aims for clarity. Variable names are descriptive. Functions are small and focused. The project favors straightforward logic over clever tricks.

Extending SourceCoin-Legacy
- Adding new features: You can add more transaction types, support multi-signature wallets, or implement a more advanced consensus algorithm. Start with small, testable changes to avoid destabilizing the core.
- Improving security: You can implement hardware wallet integration, secure key storage, and encryption at rest. Build a test suite that exercises security-critical paths.
- Networking enhancements: You can add peer-to-peer networking, message broadcasting, and synchronization across multiple local nodes. Start with a simple local mesh network model.
- API expansion: Extend the API with new endpoints for rate limiting, wallet import/export, or advanced search capabilities. Keep the API versioned to avoid breaking changes for users.

API documentation overview
- The API surface is intentionally small. It focuses on core actions required to interact with a minimal cryptocurrency: view the chain, create wallets, and submit transactions.
- Endpoints are documented with example payloads and responses. JSON is the primary data interchange format.
- Authentication considerations: The default API is not designed for public exposure. In learning setups, you can keep it local and use basic authentication or token-based access to limit exposure during experiments.

Development workflow
- Cloning and branching: Create a feature branch for each change. Keep commits focused and small. Write tests for new functionality.
- Running tests: Use the test suite to verify behavior after changes. Ensure the tests cover edge cases, such as handling invalid signatures or negative transfer amounts.
- Documentation updates: Update docs and in-line comments whenever you add or modify features. Clear documentation helps future contributors understand your changes.
- Code reviews: If you work with others, submit pull requests with a clear description of the change, its motivation, and potential impacts. Include tests and usage examples when possible.

Release management
- Versioning: Use semantic versioning for releases (major, minor, patch). Each release notes the changes, the new features, and any bug fixes.
- Asset packaging: The releases page hosts platform-specific assets. Each asset is tested for basic functionality on its target platform.
- Changelog: Keep a simple changelog that the community can read quickly. The changelog helps users see what changed and why it matters.
- Security fixes: If you discover vulnerabilities, patch quickly and publish a new release with a clear explanation of the fix and the affected areas.

Roadmap and future ideas
- Cross-platform wallets: Extend support to more platforms and provide native binaries for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Enhanced privacy: Introduce optional privacy features using simple cryptographic techniques that still maintain transparency in the chain.
- Richer API: Add endpoints for batch transactions, address-to-address metadata, and transaction templates to facilitate automation.
- Graphical user interface: Build a minimal desktop UI that interacts with the API for users who prefer a GUI over a CLI.
- Educational notebooks: Create notebooks that walk through the codebase step-by-step, highlighting how data flows from wallet to blockchain to API.

How to contribute to the README and documentation
- Improve examples: Add new, realistic example workflows that reflect how a user might employ the wallet in day-to-day tasks.
- Expand API docs: Flesh out endpoint schemas, typical request/response payloads, and error handling strategies.
- Clarify data models: Add more diagrams or pseudo-entity-relationship views to describe blocks, transactions, and wallets.
- Provide cross-language references: If you plan to explore porting the project to other languages, include starter guides and mapping tables.

Design decisions and tradeoffs
- Simplicity vs scale: The project favors readability and clarity over performance. This makes it easier to learn and extend but means it is not optimized for production-scale throughput.
- Deterministic behavior: The design uses deterministic algorithms with clear inputs and outputs. This makes it straightforward to test and reason about.
- Local persistence: JSON-based persistence keeps data human-readable and easy to inspect. It also reduces setup friction for learners, though it’s not suitable for high-security storage.
- Security practicality: The wallet and signing flow demonstrate cryptographic concepts without introducing heavy security layers. In a learning context, you can later replace the crypto primitives with stronger implementations.

Illustrative usage examples
- Creating a wallet and checking balance:
  - Generate a new key pair and address in the wallet module.
  - Query the API for the balance of that address, which calculates the net from the chain.
- Submitting a transaction:
  - Build a transaction payload with sender, recipient, and amount.
  - Sign the payload with the sender’s private key.
  - Send the signed transaction to the API and await mining.
- Mining a block:
  - Start the miner and watch how pending transactions get packaged into a block.
  - When a valid nonce is found, the block is appended to the chain and balances update accordingly.
- Inspecting the chain:
  - Retrieve the full blockchain and inspect each block’s content.
  - Verify that previous_hash values are consistent across blocks.

Notes on formatting and content style

What you’ll find in the codebase (high-level)
- A lightweight blockchain implementation that demonstrates block creation, chain validation, and simple proof-of-work.
- A straightforward wallet module that handles key generation, address derivation, signing, and verification.
- A minimal API surface that allows users to query chain data, submit transactions, and trigger mining.
- A small set of tests and examples that illustrate core flows and help beginners see how the components interact.

Accessibility and compatibility notes
- Platform coverage: The release assets are prepared to run on common platforms, including Windows and Unix-like systems. Choose the asset that matches your OS exactly to avoid setup friction.
- Python version: The code is written for a modern Python 3.x environment. If you encounter syntax or import issues, ensure your interpreter is up to date.
- Dependencies: The project relies on a small set of dependencies that are easy to install with pip. Using a virtual environment helps keep dependencies isolated and clean.

Security considerations and learning opportunities
- Signing and verification: The wallet uses digital signatures to authenticate transactions. This is a good starting point to learn how signatures work in distributed systems.
- Data integrity: The blockchain ensures that altering a block would require recomputing hashes for subsequent blocks. This creates a chain of trust that is easy to analyze in a learning context.
- Private key handling: Treat private keys as highly sensitive data. In practice, install the keys in secure storage or a hardware wallet and avoid exposing them in code or logs.
- Network exposure: In learning environments, keep the API and nodes on a private network or localhost. This reduces exposure to the public internet while you experiment.
